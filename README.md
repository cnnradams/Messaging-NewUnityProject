# Messaging-NewUnityProject / jmessage

jmessage was created in a week for a hackathon.

jmessage is a cool tool you can use to message people in a group or have chats with another person.
It features super cool features such as unread messages, sounds for user activity, server commands, groups, profile pictures, and nicknames
