<h1>setup tutorial</h1>
In order to set up jmessage for use, simply put the "Messaging-NewUnityProject.jar" and "Server-NewUnityProject.jar" files into a folder of your choosing. Next, create a file named "ip-conf.txt" in the same folder as the .jar file. Either put localhost or an IP of your choosing that has been forwarded with the port 8743 in the text file. Now, create a file named "start.bat", edit it, and put the following text into it:
<pre>
@echo off
java -Xms1G -Xmx1G -jar Server-NewUnityProject.jar
pause
</pre>
Just run "start.bat". The server's up now, so you can just run "Messaging-NewUnityProject" and you'll be able to login!

<h1>credential features</h1>
<h4>nicknames & usernames</h4>
You can set your nickname and username in the login screen, and also later change your nickname once logged in by clicking on your profile pane.
<h4>profile pictures</h4>
The default profile picture is that of a silly stickman. However, you can change this by clicking on your profile picture in the top left.
<h1>chat features</h1>
<h4>one-on-one chats</h4>
You can have one-on-one chats with your buddies. Keep in mind this isn't P2P - it still goes through a server!
<h4>group chats</h4>
Group chats can be created by anybody, and everyone who is online can join in. Group chats are easy to make - click the Add Group button, specify the group name / topic, and you're good to go.
<h4>message notifications</h4>
When someone messages you, either in a group or one-on-one, you'll hear a sound play. In addition, if you're not in the chat that the person messaged you in, then the chat will be highlighted <font color = #e0c500>yellow!</font>
<h4>mentions</h4>
If a person mentions you (@yourname) in chat, then you'll hear a special sound play to let you know they want your attention.
<h1>server features</h1>
<h4>moderation</h4>
Server owners can remove groups and users from jmessage. If they remove a user, the user will be booted back to the login screen.
<h4>error handling</h4>
The server will automatically handle errors for both users and the server. For example, if a user loses connection, they'll be sent back to the login screen so they can try to connect again.
<h1>other features</h1>
<h4>user activity sounds</h4>
jmessage will make sounds if any users in the program log in or log out, so you'll be notified when your buddies are online.
